# Path Finding Visualizer


This project is a web-based application for visualizing various pathfinding algorithms.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://karanrana097.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/).

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization:** Visualize pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra's, etc.
- **Maze Generation:** Generate random mazes for pathfinding simulations.
- **Customization:** Customize start and end points, obstacle placement, and visualization speed.
- **Responsive UI:** User-friendly interface suitable for desktop and mobile browsers.

## Algorithms Supported

- A* Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for DOM manipulation
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting the live demo

## Usage

1. **Select Algorithm:** Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. **Place Start and End:** Click on the grid to place start and end nodes.
3. **Add Obstacles:** Draw obstacles by clicking and dragging on the grid.
4. **Visualize:** Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action.

## Installation

No installation required. Just open the [live demo](https://karanrana097.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/) in your web browser.
